# ECS_System
Prototype project on Entity Component Systems for the purpose of data-oriented design
For the past while I have been interested in the concept of high-performance computing that avoids cache misses by following Data Oriented Design principles rather than standard Object-Oriented approaches. In this effort to get better a coding I have begun work on creating my own Entity Component System based around articles I have been reading by skipjack.

The library that I have been working on is still a work in progress but when completed should work as template-based single include header file but is still in early stages and missing a lot of features currently.
 Please feel free to check it out though
